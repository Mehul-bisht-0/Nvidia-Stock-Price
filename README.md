##  Nvidia-Stock-Price

This repository contains a simple **machine learning project** that predicts the stock price movement of **Nvidia (NVDA)** using a **Random Forest Classification model**. It uses historical stock data and derives key indicators to train the model and predict whether the stock price will go up or down.

>  *The model is in its early stage and may require improvements in accuracy and feature engineering in future updates.*

### Project Structure:

* `NVDA.csv`: Historical stock data of Nvidia.
* `NVDA.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing data preprocessing, model training, and prediction.
* `README.md`: Project documentation.

### Features:

* Preprocessing of stock data (including moving averages and percentage change).
* Binary classification using Random Forest to predict stock movement.
* Easy-to-follow notebook with visualizations and accuracy output.
